**Analytical skill** is the ability to deconstruct information into smaller categories in order to draw conclusions.

Analytical Thinking  
	• “Critical,” is derived from the Greek word krisis, which means “to separate.”  
	• Linear, logical thinking  
	• To analyze what is there  
Creative Thinking 
	• Non-traditional thinking is required to create the non-traditional systems needed for the non-typical situations.  
	• Non-Linear thinking  
	• Contemplate what is not there.  
	• “Vision” was defined by Jonathan Swift as “the art of seeing the invisible.”  
 Quick Thinking  
	• Speed in and of itself is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for critical  
	thought.  
	• It must be supplemented with either creative or analytical thought—and sometimes with both. Hasty reactions unaccompanied by deliberate thought can have disastrous results at both personal and corporate levels.
