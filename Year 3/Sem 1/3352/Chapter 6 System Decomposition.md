### System Design
Transformation of an analysis model into a system design model.
Activities:
	Identify design goals and **prioritize** the qualities of the system they should optimize
	Design initial subsystem decomposition
		Break system into smaller parts based on use case and analysis models
		Developers use **standard architectural styles** as a starting point
	Refine and redesign until all goals are satisfied

### Subsystems
To reduce complexity of the solution domain, decompose it into subsystems
Subsystems: A **replaceable** part of the system with well-defined **interfaces** that encapsulate the state and behavior of its classes
