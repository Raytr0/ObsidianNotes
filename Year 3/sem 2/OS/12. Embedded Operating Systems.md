### What is an embedded OS?
• It is a software system that provides an operating system (—like) services to applications running on an embedded system.
• Embedded systems operate in unique and demanding environments, therefore the design of an EOS (Embedded OS) needs to account for that.
### System characteristics
• Embedded system has a specific set of functions geared to the domain it is operating under.
• These systems are often tightly integrated into their environment. 
• There may be real time constraints on the need to interact with the environment — for example, sense motion of particular speed and precision. 
• Embedded systems can be built both on top of microprocessors and microcontrollers.
### What are some of the unique design requirements of an EOS?
• Real-time operation: Most provide soft real-time operation support with hard real-time support under limited circumstances. 
• Reactive operation: Since the system is integrated closely with the environment, the OS needs to support applications that that work under an ‘event-driven’ paradigm. Combined with real-time operation, this often requires specific redesign of I/O and interrupt mechanism. 
• Configurability: Because there are thousands of different types of embedded systems. Some OSs may not support all typical general purpose OS functionalities. 
• I/O device flexibility: Make support for specific I/O devices configurable, rather than making them an integral part of the OS kernel. (Contrast this to how some devices like secondary storage and file system management are an integral part of general purpose OS). 
• Redesigned protection mechanics: EOS applications are cooperative. Therefore many protection mechanisms (e.g. address space isolation through base and limit registers) are not that essential compared to general purpose OS. 
• Direct use of interrupts: EOS needs to support user processes interacting directly with interrupts. This follows from the design need of reactive operations since interrupts trigger reactive event handlers.
### Essential components to be developed for the target board
### Boot loader 
• As with a general purpose OS, boot loader is responsible for loading the OS kernel into the memory. But since the BIOS-like functionality of a motherboard is not available, the developer needs to worry more about this step. 
• Functions of the boot loader are still the same: 
Embedded processor/microcontroller executes ROM code to load first stage boot loader from locations in board (internal flash memory, SD card, or a serial port) depending on the board type. 
This initializes essential components and loads the second stage boot loader.
Second stage boot loader loads the kernel and root file system from flash memory to RAM, control is then passed to kernel.
• Embedded systems developers often use a standard boot loader — like ‘Das U-Boot’ for programming the boot loader specific to the board they are using.
### Kernel
• Most embedded operating systems allow the kernel to be heavily customized. 
• Developers can choose from a wide range of modules and configurations that provide functionalities for: 
	• Memory management 
	• Process/ Thread management 
	• Inter-process communication
	• Device drivers for various connected I/O devices. 
	• File system. 
	• Network and communication
### Root file system
File system in EOS often is a single level hierarchy
### Two approaches to developing an EOS
• Adapting an existing general purpose operating system (example: embedded Linux). 
	• An existing general purpose OS can by adapted by adding a few additional functionalities (e.g. real-time scheduling, efficient interrupt handling) and removing simplifying few functionalities (e.g. virtual memory management and paging) 
	• Advantages: Familiarity of development (e.g. you already know how to handle POSIX based OS) and portability. 
	• Disadvantage: It can be hard to optimize it specifically for real-time operations.
• Purpose built embedded operating system (example: TinyOS, eCos) 
	• Building an EOS ground up with necessary functionalities. 
	• Advantages : More efficient in handling real-time requirements, lightweight. 
	• Disadvantages: Needs much more effort upfront. It can be hard to debug due to less community support
### TinyOS
A really tiny OS — takes 400 bytes of memory.
• TinyOS is a very good example of a purpose built embedded operating system. 
• It was designed mainly for networks of small wireless sensors. Therefore, it should be compact enough to be suited for tiny architectures.

Example applications:
• Accelerometers for collecting synchronized data on Golden Gate Bridge for structural health monitoring.
• Microphone sensors observe and report seismic events on the Tungurahua volcanoes in Ecuador
Design Goals:
Allow high concurrency: Data from all sensors must concurrently be processed
Limited buffering support
Operate under limited resources
Adapt to hardware evolution since hardware updates fast with new sensors and platforms on a regular basis.
Be robust: Once deployed, they should run for months and years unattended.
### TinyOS components
It does not have an identifiable “kernel”.
TinyOS consists of a set of small reusable "components" that preform simple tasks, written in nesC programming language.
Components in the application are connected according to the overall design. Some serve as wrappers for hardware, while others handle higher-level functionality. Each component exposes interfaces to interact with others. They communicate by posting tasks to one another using deferred execution and handle events triggered by other components, such as the completion of posted tasks.
![[Pasted image 20250424223639.png|300]]
Component specification:
• Components are designed around interfaces 
• ***Provides*** interface are functionality that the component “provides”, and therefore other components can invoke. The providing component is responsible for implementing that functionality. 
• ***Uses*** interface calls other components and responds asynchronously to the response events of those calls.

### TinyOS separates specification from implementation
![[Pasted image 20250424231911.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250424231939.png]]
Instead of “processes”, process-like entities are called “tasks” in TinyOS.

### Scheduling
Tasks are non-preemptive, meaning they do not interrupt each other once running. However, an event trigger can preempt a running task. This design supports soft real-time constraints by allowing timely handling of critical events.
• The default is a FIFO scheduler. 
• It loops through the list of tasks one after the other. There is a guarantee that the tasks will be executed (since it is a FIFO scheduler). 
• If the FIFO queue is empty, the processor goes to sleep, thereby saving energy.
### Concurrency
Important to consider race conditions
The OS provides a way for applications to declare portion of tasks as atomic — this is implemented by disabling interrupt during execution.

### eCos (Embedded Configurable Operating System)
In embedded systems, the relationship between hardware and the OS is essentially reversed compared to general-purpose systems. While general-purpose OSes expect hardware to support their needs—such as MMUs enabling virtual memory via TLBs—embedded OSes must instead adapt to a wide variety of hardware platforms. This is managed through a highly configurable OS design, as exemplified by systems like eCos.

### eCos components
A main design goal for eCos is easy portability across different hardware platforms.

### HAL implementation example

### eCos kernel
Design Goals:
• Minimize interrupt latency: Minimize the time it takes from the triggering of the interrupt to the start of ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) execution. 
• Minimize task switching latency: Minimize the time between ready —> running latency of a thread. 
• Low memory footprint of the running processes. 
• Deterministic behaviour: The algorithms implemented in the kernel should be predictable and bounded to meet real-time application requirements. Remember the hard real-time Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) algorithm?
### How does the application code make use of kernel functionalities?
The kernel exposes C APIs for the applications: cyg_thread_create() cyg_mutex_lock()
There are also packages that help applications port POSIX based applications to eCos applications. (Example, if the developer wants to use pthread_create() instead)
![[Pasted image 20250425002030.png|400]]
### eCos I/O subsystem
• The main role of the eCos I/O subsystem is to provide support for the device drivers of the thousands of different varieties of I/O devices, such as sensors and actuators, that can be connected to the system. 
• Standard I/O drivers like ethernet, flash memory interfaces, serial devices, etc. are available out of the box through the eCos configurator tool.
eCos uses a **split interrupt model**: Interrupt processing is divided responsibility between ISR (Interrupt Service Routing) and DSR (Deferred Service Routing)
![[Pasted image 20250425003608.png]]
### eCos Scheduler
• Bitmap Scheduler: Pre-emptive priority scheduler — the problem that (some of) you solved in the midterm.
• The user can configure the priority range: 8, 16, or 32 level priority
• Caveat: Only one thread can exist at any given priority level.
• Once the thread is in “ready” state, the bitmap is set to 1 for the corresponding priority level. The kernel can select the next thread to run by identifying the position of the most significant 1 bit in the bitmap
![[Pasted image 20250425003814.png]]
### eCos I/O scheduler
The second available scheduler is a multilevel queue scheduler. (We have studied this before)![[Pasted image 20250425005232.png]]
### eCos thread synchronization
1. Semaphores (both binary and counting ones). • Counting semaphores can be used to wait on hardware interrupts. (Example: each thread sends request to a weather station sensor for temperature reading. If the sensors are busy, then the thread can wait on the counting semaphore) 
2. Conditional variables: Blocks and wakes up a thread based on specific conditions. Applications can implement Monitors using this.
3. Event flags: This is like conditional variables, but for specific events. A 32 bit word is associated with events of different types. A thread can wait on a particular bit (one event) or a combination of bits. (The only supported logical formula for this is pure conjunction or pure disjunction, i.e., the formula cannot be a mix of “ANDs” and “ORs”)
4. Messaging based synchronization: Threads can block and wake based on messages on the mailbox provided by the kernel. 
5. Spinlocks: Test and set based mutual exclusion. But since the scheduler can use preemptive priority based scheduling, this can lead to deadlock in single processor systems.
