### Instruction pipeline
![[Pasted image 20250302171157.png]]
1.  Fetch instruction
	1. Copy contents of PC (Program Counter) into MAR.
	2. Send ‘read’ signal to read from memory.
	3. Copy contents of MDR into IR
	4. Increment PC. [Note: PC holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched. IR holds the current instruction]
2. Decode the instruction (evaluate address, if necessary)
3. Fetch operands from memory
4. Execute the instruction
5. Store results to register/memory.

### (Virtual) Memory management
MMU (Memory Management Unit) within the CPU provides support (through Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), a specialized cache providing associate mapping) for virtualization of memory.
Processes can use logical address spaces (size greater than the physical size of the memory), and OS can use the MMU support to manage logical → physical mapping.

### Memory management
• Ideal memory is fast, large, and cheap – but also a fantasy! Solution is memory hierarchy: Memory is arranged in a hierarchy of fast and expensive memory to slow and cheap memory. 
• OS needs to be in charge of migrating data between these layers (e.g. nonvolatile storage → main memory). 
• Going from low capacity internal registers to high capacity nonvolatile storage, we get:
	a. Decreasing cost per bit
	b. Increasing capacity
	c. Increasing access time
	d. Decreasing frequency of access to the memory by the processor

Hardware manages cache through the use of cache lines (fixed block of memory, often 64 bytes, unit that can be transferred back and forth from main memory). For any memory access, the hardware will first check the L1/L2 cache (a cache hit; only 3-5 clock cycles). If there is a cache miss, the data (the cache line) needs to be fetched from memory (hundreds of clock cycles).

Why the memory hierarchy works well? One reason is locality of reference: the phenomenon of the same value or related storage locations being frequently accessed.

### Input/Output (I/O)
Input/Output is managed by careful OS, device driver, and the device controller. 
Controller – an embedded computer that controls data in and out of the device. Aware of the electromechanical details of the device, but provides a clean abstraction. 
Device driver – Software that interfaces with the controller. Think of it as an extension of the OS (remember the access protection rings). Provided by device manufacturers (often is a cause of big problems; blue screen of death).

Three ways a device driver can perform I/O operations
1.Busy waiting: driver continuously polls in a loop to check if I/O is done.
2.Interrupt driven I/O

3.DMA: Direct Memory Access

What happens if and interrupt occurs while another is being processed?
Two approaches: 
1. Disable all other interrupt processing while an existing interrupt is being processed 
![[Pasted image 20250302181139.png]]
2. Use a priority scheme

### Buses
PCIe: Serial bus (uses lane; 1,4,6,8 lanes. Each lane consists of two separate data transmission- one for sending and one for receiving data). Most devices are connected using a PCIe bus now. DMI (Direct Media Interface) : Too many devices, so a central hub. DDR4 bus: fast communication with memory.

### Booting the OS
The computer provides some infrastructure to help with the boot process: ROM (flash memory); MBR (Master Boot Record) in hard drive. 
BIOS based boot process 
1. The computer is set up to fetch and execute predefined instructions located in a hardcoded address in flash memory (ROM). 
2. This firmware checks everything is working fine (Power On Self Test – POST). Detects memory module, clock, various controllers, PCI(e) devices. Also allows interrupt (you can enter the boot setup process by pressing (often) F2. 
3. Read the first segment of the hard disk (Master Boot Record program, MBR) 
4. MBR will call the boot loader program. This determines which partition is active (in other words, which OS to load). There are many different boot loaders; Linux machines typically use GRUB boot loaders, GRUB can invoke and load Windows through the Windows boot loader. 
5. Once the boot loader loads the OS, the OS takes control and sets up everything (IDT, scheduler, file system, virtual memory, etc.); everything we will study in this course. 
BIOS is almost obsolete in modern computer. Replaced by UEFI (United Extensible Firmware Interface), a more complex boot process (although it is backwards compatible to BIOS). It is possible to develop UEFI applications – almost akin to a mini OS. - BIOS could only support up to 16 bit instructions (real mode execution in x86 based CPUs). As devices became more complex, there was a need for better support through a pre-OS initialization framework. UEFI filled that gap with its ability to execute instructions in protected mode (32 bit instructions), thereby accessing larger address space.
