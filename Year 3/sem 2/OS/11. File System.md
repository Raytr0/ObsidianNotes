• Files perform three essential functions: 
	• A way to store very large amount of information 
	• Persistent information — information stays even after the process is done executing. 
	• Sharing information — multiple processes must be able to access the information at once. 
• As with most constructs in an OS, file provides abstraction too. 
	• Process : abstraction of the execution of a processor. 
	• Virtual memory : abstraction of physical memory 
	• File: abstraction of persistent information in storage.

### File Types
Files can contain pretty much any type of data
	• Files can be identified through their attributes: 
	• Name: human readable file name 
	• Identifier : human non-readable name 
	• Type 
	• Location: Pointer to the location of the file in a device that stores the file. 
	• Size. 
	• Protection attributes: who can read/write/ execute 
	• Timestamp information
### The OS provides a set of system calls for user processes to operate on the files
Create
Delete
Open
Close
Read
Write
Append: Restricted form of Write, can only add data to the end of the file
Seek: For random-access files, this is needed to specify where to get the file, this is a system call
Get Attributes
Set Attributes
Rename
### open() system call
• Most of these file operations involve searching for the file within a directory entry. Therefore, to avoid repeatedly doing so for each operation, most OSs provide a file open() system call that (creates and) returns a pointer to an entry in the open-file table

### File system layout in a disk
• Modern hard drives support Logical Block Addressing (LBA), which replaces the traditional device-dependent addressing (platter → track → sector) with a sequential block numbering system starting from 0. 
• The OS uses LBA to manage the file system and access data on secondary storage without needing to handle physical disk details. The device firmware can translate these LBAs into hardware specific addresses.

### File allocation methods
### Contiguous allocation
![[Pasted image 20250424005124.png|200]]
• Each file occupy contiguous blocks on the device. 
• Very simple allocation method since you need only 2 pieces of information to locate a file — the starting block and the number of blocks. 
• Disadvantages: 
	• (Same disadvantage as contiguous allocation of processes to memory). Disk can become fragmented. 
	• Determining upfront how many blocks to allocate.
### Linked-list allocation
![[Pasted image 20250424011444.png|300]]
• Disadvantages:
• Random access into a location of the file can be slow.
• Each block takes up some space to keep track of the next block
• Solution to this problem is keeping track of the block pointers in a table in memory instead — File Allocation Table (FAT). • Disadvantage of that: it takes up memory!

### Indexed allocation (i-node)
Indexed allocation solves both external fragmentation (by allowing non-contiguous allocation) and the memory space problem (by storing file-to-block mappings in a separate index structure, rather than within the blocks themselves).
• Each file has an index structure (e.g., an inode in UNIX-like systems) that stores pointers to its allocated blocks. • It is possible to load the i-nodes of only open files in the memory — saves space. • Different ways to organize the index structure for large files: • Linked index blocks: If one index block is full, a pointer links to another index block. • Multilevel indexed blocks: Used in UNIX ext4.
