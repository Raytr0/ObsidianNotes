Advantages: Increased cpu utilization, increased degree of multiprogramming, less I/O for loading pages.
Also can share system libraries

### When are pages loaded into memory?
• An effective strategy is demand paging: Load the pages into memory from secondary storage only when the process’s execution access those pages

### Page fault
MMU recognizes process is referencing invalid page, raises a trap (interrupt) to the os.
• Major page fault: Occurs when the requested page is not in memory and must be loaded from disk 
• Minor page fault: Occurs when the requested page is not mapped in the process’s address space but is still in memory. Example: shared library pages.

### Page fault handling
How does it know which frames are free? 
It keeps a free frame list

### Page Replacement

### Page replacement algorithm
Page Fault Frequency:
• The number of frames (connected broadly to the size of main memory) impact the page fault frequency. • Why? Because with more frames, there is less need to “replace” a frame.

### FIFO page replacement algorithm:
First in first out
![[Pasted image 20250423213314.png]]
Lots of replacing, does not account for most frequently accessed pages thus increasing fault rates.

### Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm

### Frame allocation
Equal allocation: each process gets the equal amount of frames m/n
Proportional allocation: since processes need differing sizes of memory![[Pasted image 20250423213827.png|200]]
Where si is the virtual memory

### Global page replacement
Global replacement allows the OS to select frames across processes for replacement when there is a demand for frames
This leads to processes affecting other processes since demand is introduced and may take away resources.
but this does allow dynamic allocation of memory
to balance this, a common strategy is to use a reaper process: A background OS process runs regularly (when free frame availability falls under a specified threshold) to gobble up unused frames from all processes (e.g. using LRU) method and add them to a free frame list to be allocated to other processes on demand.
