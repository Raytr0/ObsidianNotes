### Understanding I/O
• Heterogeneous devices: Magnetic hard drives, Solid State Drives, Ethernet and network controllers, keyboards, printers, etc
• Helpful to group these set of I/O devices as: 
	• Human readable devices that interact with humans: display, keyboard. 
	• Machine readable devices : hard drives 
	• Communication devices: Modems and other network devices that communicate across a network channel.
I/O devices also have varying Data Rates, Applications, Complexity, and Errors

### How does the OS manage such disparate devices?

### Kernel’s I/O system structure

### Data transfer between OS and devices
![[Pasted image 20250423231624.png]]
### Buffers are essential for data transfer
Ease of transfer and speed missmatch between consumer and producer
### A major I/O system is secondary storage: hard disk drives and NVM devices

### Transfer latency for magnetic hard disk drives
• Once the device is ready to transfer data, the access time is the sum of three distinct latencies. 
• Seek time: Time required to move the arm to the required track ( ≤ 10 ms) 
• Rotation latency: Time required for the desired sector to rotate under the read/write head of the arm. 
• 1/2r(where, r : rotation speed in revolutions per second, typical is 5k-15k rpm) [let us prove this]
• Transfer time: Time taken to transfer b bytes to and from the disk. • b/rN(where, N: Number of bytes on a track)
• Total access time = Tseek time + 1/2r + b/rN
### Total access time variability
• Total access time also depends a lot on the allocation of the data in the sectors.

### Disk scheduling
![[Pasted image 20250423235011.png]]
• Can the device driver do better (or worse) by choosing a particular order of processing these requests?
### FIFO disk scheduling

### SCAN algorithm (or the “Elevator” algorithm)

### Nonvolatile Memory Devices (NVM)
Examples: Solid State Drives, USB Flash drives, Smartphone memory
Cost per bit of NVM is coming down rapidly.
Data cannot be overwritten, it has to be explicitly erased then written over
After a certain number of these “erase cycles” they no longer retain data. Therefore, NVMs are rated as “drive writes per day”. E.g., a 1TB, 5 DWPD means the drive can be re-written 5 times in a day without failure till the warranty period.

Garbage collection:
1. Data from partially filled blocks are copied to new fresh blocks. 
2. The partially filled blocks are completely erased. 
3. NVM drives often keeps about 20% capacity aside for this operation (over provisioning)
