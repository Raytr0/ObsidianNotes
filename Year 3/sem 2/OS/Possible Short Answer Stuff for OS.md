### Memory Management
base register: points to location of the process
limit register: specifies offset from the base register value
contiguous memory allocation: Limit registers provide convenient way to manage virtual to physical memory translation
Modern OSs: does not allocation memory in contiguous locations
Multiprogramming:
Virtual Memory: Memory that is directly accessible by the OS, where it is not limited by the main memory size but the secondary memory.
Relocation: Processes swapping in and out of memory to disk storage
Protection: Processes should not interfere with another process
Logical address space: address generated by a process
Physical address: logical address + base register
Dynamic Relocation: Change value of base register
Paging: memory divided into pages that are address spaces

### Virtual Memory Management
Major Page Fault: When page is not in memory and needs to be loaded from disk
Minor Page Fault: When page is not mapped in address space but is still in memory
Global page replacement: can allocate frames from other sources
Local page replacement: allocates fram from same process
Page fault frequency: how often page fault happens, more frames = less faults
FIFO page replacement: first in first out 
Beladys anomaly: page fault may increase in the number of frames, graph has spike instead of normal exponetional reduction
Least recently used: check when page was last accessed and move to tail, this reduces page faults, but this ends up needing hardware support to keep track of accessed memory frames.
Global page replacement: allows OS to select frames across different process for replacement when there is demand, causes other processes preformance to be impacted
Thrashing: side effect of global page replacement algos
### Device Management
Heterogeneous devices: Magnetic hard drives, Solid State Drives, Ethernet and network controllers, keyboards, printers, etc
Stream oriented data transfer
block oriented data transfer
Seek time: time required to move arm to required track
Rotation latency: time required to rotate the desired sector under the read/write head of the arm
Transfer time: time needed to transfer b bytes 
Fifo disk scheduling: lots of ups and downs
SCAN algorithm: arm moves in one direction 100-200 then 200-0 back and fourth and so on.
Nonvolatile Memory Devices: NAND semiconductors are arranged in theform of pages and blocks
### File System
Read notes
### Embedded Operating System
Boot Loader: responsible for loading OS kernel into memory
First stage boot loader: initialize essential components and load second stage
Second stage boot loader: loads kernel and root file system from flash into RAM
### TinyOS
no identifiable kernel
consists of small reusable components that preform simple tasks written in nesC
### Distributed Operating Systems
Client Server Model: unreliable communication since can suffer packet loss
Middleware: basically translation service
Load balancing: strive to get equal load throughout the system in terms of metrics like CPU utilization. 
Load sharing: Only move to help overburdened CPU
Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors: type 2 has a Host OS block
