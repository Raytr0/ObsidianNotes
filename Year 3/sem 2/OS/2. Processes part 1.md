• We need a word to define the set of CPU activities that the OS manages – jobs, tasks, user programs? Processes! • Many definitions, all consistent with each other. 
• A program in execution. 
• An instance of a program running on a computer. 
• The entity that can be assigned to and executed on a processor. 
• A unit of activity characterized by the execution of a sequence of instructions, a current state, and an associated set of system resources. 
• A program is a passive entity, whereas a process is an active entity.

### Layout of a process in memory

OS manages the life-cycle of all the Processes in memory 
The address of the base register (a physical address) points to the location where the process is located. 
The limit register specifies an offset from the base register value. 
We can add base and limit registers together to access a location within that process. 
For contiguous memory allocation: Limit registers provide a convenient way to manage virtual →physical memory translation. 
Memory separation between processes. 
Modern OSs do NOT allocate memory in contiguous locations. 
We will study this complex process soon in coming weeks.

OS needs to keep track of information in processor registers

### Process Control Block (PCB)
• Identifier: A unique identifier associated with this process, to distinguish it from all other processes.
• State: If the process is currently executing, it is in the running state.
• Priority: Priority level relative to other processes.
• Program counter: The address of the next instruction in the program to be executed.
• Memory pointers: Include pointers to the program code and data associated with this process, plus any memory blocks shared with other processes.
• Context data: These are data that are present in registers in the processor while the process is executing.
• I/O status information: Includes outstanding I/O requests, I/O devices assigned to this process, a list of files in use by the process, and so on.
• Accounting information: May include the amount of processor time and clock time used, time limits, account numbers, and so on.

### Process state machine
Creation:
1. System initialization
2. Execution of a process-creation system call by a running process
3. A user request to create a new process
4. Initiation of a batch job
Termination:
1. Normal exit (voluntary)
2. Error exit (voluntary)
3. Fatal error (involuntary)
4. Killed by another process (involuntary)

### Parent-child process creation
• Process creation mechanism relies on parent-child relationship.
	• Parent process responsible for creating the child process.
• We need to be careful to not overload the systems. Therefore, when creating a child process, parent process may restrict the child process to the set of available resources available to the parent process
• Parent process can pass necessary initialization data to the child process for its execution.

### Creation of new process using fork(); exec() system call
[Part 1: Fork]

[Part 2: Exec]

[Part 3: Wait]

• After the fork() call, both parent and child processes continue execution from the next instruction. 
Key differences in the fork() return value: 
	• Child process: Returns 0. 
	• Parent process: Returns the child's process ID (nonzero). 
	• The parent can choose to kill(child_pid, signal) the child process by sending a kill signal (these signals are defined as macros in signals.h)
