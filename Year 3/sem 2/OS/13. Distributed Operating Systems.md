### Distributed Systems
• Distributed system is a collection of processors that do not share a common clock. 
• These systems are often referred to as “nodes” on the network. 
• Each has their own memory, CPU, address, etc.

### Models of distributed systems
**Client server model — unreliable communication**
• Communication can suffer packet loss 
• Due to hardware faults and software errors (e.g. server buffer that received the request is full) 
• If a protocol does not deal with these packet losses, then it is an unreliable communication.
