### Resource access sequence from a thread’s perspective
• Request : A thread requests a resource. 
• Lock: If the resource’s lock is held by another process, then wait; otherwise lock the resource 
• Use: Performs operations on the resource. 
• Release: Release the resource and any locks held on the resource.

### Deadlock sequence

• Mutual exclusion: We have already covered this in synchronization. 
• Hold and Wait: A thread has a hold (typically through locks) on one resource, while it waits for another resource. 
• No preemption: Resources cannot be preempted. Threads have to voluntarily release the resource after it is done with the resource. 
• Circular wait: A set of N waiting threads such that T1 is waiting on T2, which in turn is waiting on T3, …., and TN waiting on T1.

### Strategies for handling deadlocks
• Deadlock prevention and avoidance. Making sure that deadlocks don’t occur in the first place. • Either through preventing the conditions that can lead to deadlock. 
• Or through OS being given a-priori list of resource requests a thread will demand. 
• Deadlock detection and recovery. If a deadlock occurred, it should be detected correctly and recovered from. 
• Deadlock ignorance: Do nothing about it. Try turning it off and back on again.

### To analyze deadlock prevention, let’s relook at the conditions that lead to deadlock
• Mutual exclusion: We pretty much can’t do anything about this. Just make sure that we are not making read-only access follow mutual exclusion protocol 
• Hold and Wait: Allocate all resources to threads at once. Alternatively, threads should release some resources before demanding more. 
	• Disadvantage: Low resource utilization. Starvation for threads that just happen to need popular resources. 
• No preemption: Either preempt the process that holds a resource and is asking for more, or preempt the process that holds the resource being requested. Allocate the resources later when all of the resources are available. 
	• Cannot work for resources like mutex/semaphores because they need to be requested in a particular order.

### Deadlock avoidance
• The strategy to avoid deadlock is to know in advance what is the sequence in which each process/thread will request resources. • Then use this knowledge to evaluate whether the requests can be fulfilled without leading to a deadlock. And if there is a chance of a deadlock, then the system can make the thread wait for a better time to request the resource. • Deadlock avoidance vary in the degree of information they need to evaluate potential deadlocks. • Simple ones can ask for the maximum number of resources of each type that a thread/process will need in its lifetime.

### States — safe states and unsafe states
• State: A snapshot of the system's resource allocation at a specific moment. • Available resources: Number of available resources of each type. • Allocated resources: Number of resources of each type allocated to each thread. • Claimed resources: Maximum resource demands of each thread (declared in advance). • Safe state: A state where the system can allocate resources to every thread (up to their maximum needs) in some order without causing a deadlock. • Unsafe state: A state where there's no guarantee that all threads can finish without a deadlock.

### Deadlock recovery strategies
• Abort: Just abort all deadlocked processes. This is the most common approach. 
• Rollback and Restart: Rollback all deadlock processes unto a checkpoint, and then restart them again. This can only work if the deadlock was nondeterministic in nature; otherwise the deadlock will happen again. 
• Sequential abort: Abort processes that are in deadlock one by one in some (well thought out) order till deadlock is resolved. 
• Sequential resource preemption: Same as sequential abort, but instead of aborting the entire process, we preempt the resource hold in some order. And the process have to request the resource again later.
