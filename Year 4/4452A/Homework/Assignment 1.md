a) 
	in the if loop, the part where it checks if the modulus remainder is equal to 1, this only checks for positive numbers and fails if the number is negative and odd.
The correct code would be x\[i]%2 != 0
b) 
	if the test case is all positive numbers, the fault would not be found \[1,3,4,5,0] expected: 4
c)
	\[-2,3,2,0,-4] expected: 2, negative numbers still get executed but fail the if statement anyways so the count is correct
d)
	Not possible. Every test case that causes the fault to be executed (negative odd number) will eventually lead to an incorrect output, which means it always results in a failure.
e)
	x[i] % 2 == 1â†’ -3 % 2 = -1, so condition evaluates false
    -3 is not recognized as a odd number, so the count is not incremented, leading to an error
f)
