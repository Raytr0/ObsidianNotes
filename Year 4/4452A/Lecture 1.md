### Validation & Verification (IEEE)
Validation : 
	The process of evaluating software at the end of software development to ensure compliance with intended usage
Verification : 
	The process of determining whether the products of a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements established during the previous phase

### Test Process Maturity
Level 0: 
	There’s no difference between testing and debugging
Level 1: 
	The purpose of testing is to show correctness
Level 2: 
	The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn’t work.
Level 3: 
	The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce the risk of using the software
Level 4: 
	Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop higher quality software
